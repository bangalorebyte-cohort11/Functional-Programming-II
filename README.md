# Functional-Programming-II


1) Let’s say you run a company and you’ve just decided to give all your employees a $10,000.00 raise. Lets implement this using functional programming. 

   ``` python
   def change_salary(salary,amt): ```

2)   ```python
   sentences = ['Mary read a story to Sam and Isla.',
             'Isla cuddled Sam.',
             'Sam chortled.'] ```

Using reduce, identify the amount of times the word 'Sam' appeared in each sentence. 

3) Please read and understand decorator_example.py. You should be able to walk me through the code tomorrow. Check documentation for unfamiliar code.
