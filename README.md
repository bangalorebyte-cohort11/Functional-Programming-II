# Functional-Programming-II


1) Let’s say you run a company and you’ve just decided to give all your employees a $10,000.00 raise. Lets implement this functional programming. 

   ``` def change_salary(salary,amt):
   

2) ``` sentences = ['Mary read a story to Sam and Isla.',
             'Isla cuddled Sam.',
             'Sam chortled.'] ```

Using reduce, identify the amount of times the word 'Sam' appeared in each sentence.
